â–  Q1:
 Write a program in C to demonstrate how to handle the pointers 
 in the program. 
Expected Output :
 Address of m : 0x7ffcc3ad291c
 Value of m : 29                                                                                              
Now ab is assigned with the address of m.                                                                    
Address of pointer ab : 0x7ffcc3ad291c                                                                       
Content of pointer ab : 29                                                                                   
The value of m assigned to 34 now.                                                                           
Address of pointer ab : 0x7ffcc3ad291c                                                                       
Content of pointer ab : 34                                                                                   
The pointer variable ab is assigned with the 
value 7 now.                                                    
Address of m : 0x7ffcc3ad291c                                                                                
Value of m : 7
